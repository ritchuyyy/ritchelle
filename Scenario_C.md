Hi **Anne**!

We have read your concerns regarding the result of your application to our internship program. We sincerely apologize for the disappointment this has caused. We understood the earnestness you have showed since you will graduate also this spring. Unfortunately, this also makes you ineligible in the future based on the [eligibility requirements](https://via.placeholder.com/790x90.png?text=eligibility+rquirements) of this program.

As much as we wanted to include you in our admissions, we regret to inform you that the class is already full and there are still more on the waitlist. 

For now, we can offer you some things:
1. You might want to read on tips and guidelines that you might find helpful in our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view). 
2. Also, please feel free to access our [resources page](https://www.codepath.org/dev-resources) for helpful guides.
3. Lastly, you can join our **mailing list** to learn more about CodePath's courses, job advice and even virtual events that you might be interested in. You can sign up [here](https://www.codepath.org/join-our-mailing-list). 

We hope for the best in your endeavors. 

Sincerely,<br>
**Ricthelle**
