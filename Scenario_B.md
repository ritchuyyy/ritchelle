Dear **Jane**,

We want to acknowledge the incredible amount of time and energy you spent on the application process. We are impressed of your work especially you have dedicated more than 10 hours just to complete your application. We understand the disppointment that entails on not being admitted into the program. 

The  [**eligibility requirements**](https:/via.placeholder.com) for each of our program have been clearly stated in the application process. However, we understand that there are times applicants might get confused with it. Based on our current sponsorships as a **non-profit organization** we can only cater to students who are enrolled in our **partner universities.**

Furthermore, we might be expanding to other countries in the future. We are even currently holding classes in Haiti and have had classes in Taiwan, too. Let us hope for the possbility that classes will also be available in Thailand. 

Again, our sincere apologies to the confusion you have had on the admission. Please, see this experience as your first step of becoming part of our program in future. We believe your skills will bring you success.

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
