Dear **Jane**,

We want to acknowledge the incredible amount of time and energy you spent to the application process. We are impressed by your work,especially considering that you have dedicated more than 10 hours completing your application. We understand how disappointing it can be not to be admitted into the program.

The  [**eligibility requirements**](https:/via.placeholder.com) for each of our programs have been clearly stated in the application process. However, we understand that there are times applicantsmay find them confusing. Based on our current sponsorships as a **non-profit organization**, we can only cater students who are enrolled in our **partner universities.**

Furthermore, we may expand to other countries in the future. In fact, we are currently holding classes in Haiti and have previously held classes in Taiwan. Let us hope for the possibility that classes will also be available in Thailand. 

Again, our sincere apologies to the confusion you have had on the admission. Please see this experience as your first step of becoming part of our program in the future. We believe your skills will bring you to success.

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
