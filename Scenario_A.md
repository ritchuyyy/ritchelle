Hi **John**!

Thank you for your message and for your interest in the Advanced track. We absolutely recognize your strong academic background and appreciate the drive youâ€™ve shown in pursuing this program.

Unfortunately, we regret to inform that we cannot transfer you to the Advanced Track. Although the first few topics are somewhat similar, there are prerequisites for each track. We want you to get the best experience possible. You can only have that when you follow the track that you qualify since the pacing of the track depends on the level of the course.

We understand this decision may be disappointing, but please know that we only want what is best for our applicants. We hope you understand and still push through with the Intermediate track. 

Thank you for your understanding, your time, and your effort throughout this process. 

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
