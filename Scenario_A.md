Hi **John**!

First, we want to acknowledge again your efforts on applying for the Interview prep program and qualifying for the beginner track.

Unfortunately, we regret to inform that we cannot transfer you to the Advanced Track. Although the first few topics are somewhat similar, there are prerequisites for each track. We want you to get the best experience possible. You can only have that when you follow the track that you qualify since the pacing of the track depends on the level of the course.

Although this decision is disappointing, please know that we only want what is best for our applicants. We hope you understand this and still push through with the beginner track. 

Thank you for your understanding, your time, and your effort throughout this process. 

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
