Hi **Dennis**!

Thank you for reaching out.

We understand that life can sometimes get in the way, and we appreciate your willingness to take responsibility and make up for the missed coursework. However, per our course policy, we have to enforce deadlines and participation requirements to ensure a consistent and effective experience for everyone.

Since you were withdrawn due to non-compliance and we did not receive a response when we initially reached out, your removal from the course is final.

That said, we value your interest in learning and your commitment to improve. You still have lifetime access to the course material using the GitHub account you signed up with. 

Let us know if you have any questions about accessing the materials or reapplying in the future.

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
