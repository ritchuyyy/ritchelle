Hi **Dennis**!

Thank you for reaching out to us about your tech fellow application.
We have read and understood your concerns. 

Here in **CodePath**, we usually wait for **two completed admission requirements** per partner school before they can start with their tech fellow training. This is a close to a month process. We understand this can be very long for you but this is part of the program.

We know that you are very excited to start with your training. As for the moment, please make use of the waiting time to prepare yourself for the upcoming training. 

Regardless, your application is complete. Congratulations on being qualified to join in our Tech Fellow Program. 

Sincerely,<br>
**Ritchelle**
